    In October 2019, fires heavily impacted all states and territories of Australia.<br>NSW and ACT even declared state of emergency due to record-breaking temperature and prolonged drought.

      The visualisation shows the states affected by the bushfire from 2019 to 2020.<br>
      We are able to see that many parts of Western Australia is experiencing the bushfire and<br>
      parts of Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Victoria have a high fire radiative power (FRP).<br>
      FRP shows the intensity of the burning which was never experienced previously, hence this is one of the worst<br>
      bushfire incident in history. Smoke from the fires has transported beyond New Zealand and the South Pacific Ocean,<br>
      thus some states such as New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory has declared state of emergency due to<br>
      the extreme situation.

               The visualisation illustrates the extreme weather condition during the bushfire season. As shown,
               we can see that Australia was experiencing extreme dry weather condition which certainly worsen the
               bushfire situation and the cause of this climate change is due to human activities. Our activities in
               the past few years were damaging to the environment, causing the occurence of bushfires every year.
               Furthermore, the combination of high temperature, low wind speed and low rainfall undoubtebly increased
               the fire risk. Thus, we should be more aware of how we treat our planet to prevent this from worsening.

            New South Wales was one of the states that was heavily impacted by the bushfires. According to its
            air quality index, we can see that it has greatly surpassed the acceptable index during the bushfire season.
            The high AQI threatens human health as it irritates our respiratory system even during short exposure.
            Some citizens in the states that were heavily impact such as New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory
            even had to wear face masks to protect themselves from the thick smoke haze.

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>

   <p style="text-align:center;">
     Looking at the visualisation above, we should be more aware of what has been happening around us and how our activities<br>
     can impact the environment. In order to maintain the sustainability of our planet, we should all commit to improve our environment.<br>
     A small gesture such as filling up our garden with native plants makes a large difference!
